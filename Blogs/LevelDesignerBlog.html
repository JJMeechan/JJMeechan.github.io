They design the game, but only portions of it. Specifically, the levels. They take the specifications given by the “gameplay designer” and get right into the details of everything involved, such as the actions, events, objects and the environment.Level designers often first sketch their ideas out on paper, or make use of some 2D drawing software. They have to imagine the experience of playing through that level by putting themselves in the shoes of the player. They need to think about how the player is supposed to feel at that time, what emotions is that level supposed to produce and what encounters/events the player will have to deal with.
